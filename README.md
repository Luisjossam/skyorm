# SkyORM for Nodejs

## Introduction

SkyORM is an object-relational mapping (ORM) library written in TypeScript, designed to facilitate interaction with relational databases in an intuitive and structured manner. Its primary goal is to allow developers to work with databases using object-oriented code instead of manually writing SQL queries.

With SkyORM, each database table is represented by a model class, enabling seamless execution of operations such as queries, insertions, and updates. Additionally, it offers a relationship system that allows defining connections between different models without the need to write complex SQL statements.
